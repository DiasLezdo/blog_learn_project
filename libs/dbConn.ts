// Why Call dbConnect in Every Request?

// Stateless Nature of Serverless Functions:

// Next.js API routes often run in serverless environments (like Vercel), where each function invocation is stateless.
// Functions can spin up and shut down rapidly, so relying on persistent connections without proper management can lead to
//  connection leaks or exhausting database resources.

// Ensuring Connection Availability:

// By calling dbConnect in each API route, you ensure that the database connection is established before performing
//  any database operations.
// This guarantees that your routes are resilient and can handle requests reliably, regardless of the deployment environment.

// -------------------------------------------------------

// How Does Connection Caching Work?

// In the lib/mongoose.js file you created, a connection caching mechanism is implemented using the global object.

//  Here's how it works:

// Explanation:

// Global Caching:

// The global object in Node.js persists across module reloads in development environments (like with Next.js's hot reloading).
// By attaching the mongoose connection to global, you ensure that the connection is reused across multiple invocations during
//  development, preventing multiple connections from being established.

// Connection Reuse:

// First Request: When dbConnect is called for the first time, it establishes a connection and stores it in cached.promise.
// Subsequent Requests: Future calls check if cached.conn exists. If it does, the existing connection is returned immediately
//  without establishing a new one.
// This mechanism ensures that only one connection is active at any given time, optimizing resource usage.

// Buffering Commands:

// The bufferCommands: false option ensures that Mongoose doesn't buffer database operations until the connection is established.
//  This is useful for handling connection errors gracefully.
